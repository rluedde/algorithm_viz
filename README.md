# Algorithm Visualizations

This repository contains JavaScript Visualizations of various sorting algorithms implemented in Javascript and P5.js.
The data being sorted are book lengths scraped from [Hamilton Book](https://www.hamiltonbook.com).

## Features:
* Books colored according to length
* UI to select what algorithm to visualize (in progress)

## Current algorithms
* Bubblesort
* Quicksort (in progress)

## Future algorithms to implement
* Merge sort
* Insertion sort
* Heap sort?
* Radix sort?

## To Use
1. `git clone https://github.com/rluedde/algorithm_viz` (or just download repository)
2. Open `index.html` in a web broswer!
